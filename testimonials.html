Even though he couldn't solve it, he collaborated with us and didn't just throw it to us to do the work. This is what I love about working at Slack, its this collaboration and camaraderie.</p>

Hossain brings technical expertise, creativity, and contagious positivity to every project. Whenever we faced challenges outside our mobile domain, he tackled them head-on, eagerly learning and problem-solving across various areas. His proactive approach inspires others to step out of their comfort zones and tackle project challenges. During difficult moments with external stakeholders, Hossain was critical in helping us navigate and build both technical and interpersonal alignment. I truly hope we have the opportunity to work together again in the future!</p>

Hossain worked well with other team members and even with difficult customers. He was always calm and respectful and was able to quickly develop new apps with complicated features, like eMBMS, LTE-B video and file delivery, 3rd party plug-ins for DRM and custom players, as well as work on other developers' code bases to fix bugs and extend new features. Hossain wrote very clean code which other developers readily accepted and leveraged. Hossain was a good multitasked and worked on multiple projects in parallel. I believe Hossain is a great individual contributor and has potential to be a team lead and manager. I'd work with Hossain again.</p>
