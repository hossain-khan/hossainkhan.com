She wrote one of the first computer programs when almost no women worked in tech — in 1842, to be precise. On Oct. 24–25, the Ada Lovelace Festival will celebrate her contributions and those of women leading tech today with talks, workshops and social activities.

This year’s event focuses on the topic of ownership. Speakers from leading enterprises — such as Volkswagen, Accenture and SAP — will engage with artists, activists and government officials to discuss who gets to own the future of the digital world, and how more people can be involved.

I’m thrilled to attend this year. Here are a few reasons why.

So, what happens when a company introduces the idea of love to the mix? And not just in a glib way, but in a way where it becomes the year’s North star; a slogan which guides meetings, management decisions and the daily attention of a 200-strong employee workforce.

If you or your team members haven’t taken the time to organize your images by adding detailed titles and meta-descriptions, that disorder can eat up your time. Every new blog post turns into a game of hide-and-seek as you scroll and scroll,  trying to find your feature image, or that infographic your designer dropped into the library. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Organizing, and finding your images, can take seconds, making your content operations workflow a whole lot smoother.

“I’m already forgetting how bad it used to be before Contentful,” she says adding that she doesn’t think she could go back. “If I ever left I would insist that the company use Contentful or a system like it.”

So what sets Contentful apart as a solution that both developers and content editors love?

Here's why. ]]></title><description><![CDATA[If you’re a manager of a team of editors, or an editor yourself, it won’t come as a surprise that research shows editors spend over half of their time on content operations. That’s a lot of time that could be spent creating high quality content which drives the business forward.   

Content operations is a term to describe the set of processes, people and technologies for strategically planning, distributing and analyzing content. These operations are increasingly becoming a core requirement for content teams. 

As an editor or manager, you’ll recognize content operations in your daily work as uploading content, updating, editing, distribution and governance. This was a very reasonable set of tasks in the early days of content marketing; posting one or two blog posts a week wasn’t a big drain on your time. Now, with huge amounts of content being created to engage keen audiences, these tasks have taken over.

Media companies lost control of content distribution and monetization, explains journalist Kyle Chayka in the Nation article, “In the Shadow of the CMS.” He believes building their own CMSes might be the key to taking back this control. “If traditional media companies can build their own distribution and monetization method via the new CMSs, then they can counter the tech duopoly’s advance on their terrain and wrest back some control,” he writes. ]]></description><link>https://www.contentful.com/blog/2019/03/07/who-really-manages-your-content/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.contentful.com/blog/2019/03/07/who-really-manages-your-content/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2019 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[4 things we learned when migrating content to Contentful ]]></title><description><![CDATA[When Esa McGavin joined Contentful as the product owner for the website she was tasked with expanding our own use of Contentful to host traditionally hardcoded content.
